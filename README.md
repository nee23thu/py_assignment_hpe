Python Scripting Assessment: String Processing

Scenario: You are tasked with writing a script to process a list of sentences in a text file. The script should analyze the text and perform several operations, such as counting words, identifying the longest word, and checking for palindromes.

Assessment Task:

Write a Python script that:

1. Reads data from a text file called sentences.txt, where each line contains a sentence. The format of the file is:

Python is fun

Radar is a palindrome

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog

A man a plan a canal Panama

2. Processes each sentence to:

o Count the number of words in each sentence.

o Identify the longest word in each sentence.

o Check if any word in the sentence is a palindrome (a word that reads the same backward and forward).


3. Writes the results to a new file called sentence_analysis.txt with the following format:

Sentence: Python is fun

Word Count: 3

Longest Word: Python

Palindromes: None


Sentence: Radar is a palindrome

Word Count: 4

Longest Word: palindrome

Palindromes: Radar
